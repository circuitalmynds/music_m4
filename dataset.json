        "description": "Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, born on September 8, 1841, in Nelahozeves, Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), was a renowned composer and one of the most celebrated figures in classical music. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's music captured the essence of his Czech heritage while incorporating elements of Romanticism, folk traditions, and symphonic grandeur.\n\nRaised in a musical family, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k displayed exceptional talent from a young age. His father recognized his potential and encouraged his musical pursuits. At the age of six, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k began studying the violin, piano, and organ. As a teenager, he honed his skills as a violist and performed in local orchestras and chamber groups.\n\nIn 1857, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k entered the prestigious Prague Organ School, where he received rigorous training in music theory and composition. Despite facing financial hardships, he persevered and graduated as a skilled organist. He then took up positions as a church organist and private music teacher to support himself.\n\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k's breakthrough came in 1873 when he won the Austrian State Stipendium, a prestigious award that provided him with financial stability. This recognition allowed him to focus entirely on composing, and his career flourished. His compositions drew inspiration from Czech folk music, incorporating its melodies and rhythms into his symphonies, chamber music, and operas.\n\nIn 1892, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's life took a pivotal turn when he accepted a position as the director of the National Conservatory of Music in New York City. This experience exposed him to American music and culture, influencing his later works. During his time in the United States, he composed some of his most famous pieces, including the \"New World Symphony\" and the \"American String Quartet.\"\n\nUpon returning to his homeland, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k continued to compose prolifically. His output during this period included symphonic works, chamber music, choral compositions, and operas. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's music gained international recognition and admiration for its emotional depth, melodic richness, and masterful orchestration.\n\nThroughout his life, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k received numerous honors and awards, solidifying his status as one of the most significant composers of his time. His impact on the world of classical music continues to resonate, inspiring generations of musicians and captivating audiences worldwide.\n\nAnton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k passed away on May 1, 1904, in Prague, leaving behind a remarkable legacy of over a thousand compositions. His works remain cherished treasures, exemplifying the power of music to transcend borders and touch the human soul with its beauty and passion.\n\nTracklist:\n1. Raps\u00f3dia\n2.

Traveling between Vienna and Pozsony, Fusz composed a number of operas and melodramas including \"Watwort,\" \"Romulus und Remus\" and \"Das Medaillon\" among others. He made contact with both Haydn and Beethoven, composed a quartet for a guitar and string trio, and wrote a number of overtures, and chamber works including a violin sonata and sonatinas for violin and piano; he was highly popular during his lifetime for his many songs, earning recognition from Beethoven among others.

        "description": "Ferenc Liszt (1811-1886) Hungarian Rhapsodies Nos.1-6 / Orchestra Version (Arr. Franz Doppler).\n*Click to activate the English subtitles for the presentation* (00:00-01:15)\n00:00 No.2 in C minor (Arr. Karl M\u00fcller-Berghaus) is perhaps the most famous of all. Dramatic, and finely scored, it develops passionate material with skill after a recitative-like opening.\n10:15 No.1 in F minor Doppler's set is 14th in Liszt's original series. Its strong main theme, a Hungarian national song without a doubt, is given a three-fold exposition, with effective major and minor alternations. The sombre colouring of the opening \u2014 Lento, quasi marcia funebre \u2014 with its fine use of clarinets, bassoons and horns, is particularly arresting, Imposing, too, is the D flat return of the main theme. Gypsy violin techniques are hinted at in the fiery presto conclusion.\n21:22 No.4 in D minor is Liszt's original No.12. After a tensely expectant opening we move to a passionate Allegro zingarese which brilliantly communicates the spirit of Hungary. The oboe features most effectively in this evocative work.\n32:57 No.6 in D flat Major \"Carnival in Pest\" was 9th in the original set. Its subtitle \u2014 Carnival in Pest \u2014 proclaims a liveliness which characterises the work from start to finish. Exhilarating dance rhythms are controlled so as to produce a care- free momentum.The variety of these six works provides its own commentary on the richness which Liszt so eagerly discovered in what was for him virgin national territory.\n44:04 No.3 in D Major is the sixth in Liszt's original order. Gypsy rhythms predominate and the opening and closing dances have great fire. The intermediate episode has a ruminatively poetic quality and is finely orchestrated, with solo clarinet being exquisitely supported by cembalon, harp and delicately textured strings.\n52:03 No.5 in E minor is dedicated to the Countess Sidonie Reviczky. It is the most lyrical of all these six works, and its neglect is hard to understand. Tonality is used by Liszt with subtle effect.\nThe work begins in E minor, but the later resort to the remote key of D flat leads to a passage of moving intensity.\n\nPhilharmonia Hungarica (1,4,6)\nLondon Philharmonic Orchestra (2,3,5)\nConductor : Willi Boskovsky\nRecorded in 1976-77, at Marl and London\nNew Mastering in 2020 by AB for CMRR\nFind CMRR's recordings on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3016eVr\n\nLiszt - Hungarian Rhapsodies 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 + P\u00b0 (Cent. rec. : Georges Cziffra) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Xvv-a5K1w&list=PL3UZpQL9LIxPwj2Gx5zMNTVdzNsUMalnE&index=2\n\nFerenc Liszt PLAYLIST (reference recordings) : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3UZpQL9LIxPwj2Gx5zMNTVdzNsUMalnE",

        "description": "Polish Chamber Philharmonic Orchestra Sopot conducted by Wojciech Rajski. Stephan Genz as the baritone and Joanna Kravchenko as the erhu player.\n\nI - The Mysterious Flute: 0:00\nII - In a Foreign Land: 5:22\nIII - On a River: 7:27\nIV - Wild Swans: 11:00\nV - Despair: 12:31\nVI - Moonlit Night: 14:44\nVII - Night View: 18:56\nVIII - Autumn Flute Song: 23:22\n\nPenderecki's Symphony No.6 was conceived in 2003 and composed between 2008-17, being originally subtitled as \"Elegy for a Dying Forest\". While revising his Symphony No.8 in 2007, Penderecki decided to introduce Chinese poems that also reflected his original ideas about the desacralization and destruction of nature. It was eventually completed as a joint commission from the Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra and Dresden Philharmonic. Its world premiere took place on September 24 of 2017, performed by the Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra conducted by Long Yu.\n\nThe songs are arranged into pairs linked by solo intermezzi performed on the erhu; a traditional Chinese bowed string instrument with a history looking back to the VII century. The erhu\u2019s unique sound colour, similar to that of the human voice, enters into an unusual, non-semantic dialogue with the poetic texts sung by the soloist. What the Symphony contributes to Penderecki\u2019s symphonic universe is a poetic warmth of the kind not to be found in his previous works in this genre; a warmth originating at the meeting point of neoromantic exuberance and impressionist clarity of orchestral textures.\n\nThe first movement opens with a brief but exhuberant introduction of oriental air. The baritone begins to sing in a manner reminiscent of Mahler. The orchestra answers with more agitated phrases. After the baritone continues, the introduction material is recapitulated. A lyrical solo of the erhu serves as a transition to the next part. The second movement begins in a darker manner, with the baritone singing pessimistic lines. Despite the brevity, melancholy is carried to the end without a shred of light.\n\nThe third movement opens with wood ostinatos, over which the baritone sings rather sadly. A slow coda, with the wood ostinatos of the beginning, leads us to the second erhu solo, whose clear and hopeful lyricism brings contrast. The fourth movement, very brief, is more dramatic in character, with menacing gestures from the orchestra that doesn't resolve.\n\nThe fifth movement is the most passionate and expressive, with the baritone singing the end of summer and the disappear of the wild swans, the arrival of winter and death. A meditative duo with the cello takes us to the most intimate moment of the work, followed by an agitated passage. A despairing coda ends the movement. The sixth movement takes the form of a nostalgic nocturne, full of mysterious colours at times menaced by dissonances. The erhu solo leads us to the next part.\n\nThe seventh movement is also nocturnal in nature, a poetic vision sung by the baritone. A brief orchestral passage leads us to the final ehru solo. The final movement opens with a brief introduction of the flute (as in the first movement). The baritone references autumn in a nostalgic tone, barely supported by a sparse orchestration. A modest, almost low-key coda ends the movement without a positive resolution.\n\n[Lyrics in the comments section]\n\nPicture: \"Wang Xizhi watching geese\" (circa XII century) by the Chinese painter Qian Xuan.\n\nMusical analysis partially written by myself.

        "description": "The eight humoresques of Antonin Dvorak's Op. 101 are largely forgotten today -- all but one of them, that is. The Humoresque in G flat major, No. 7, Op. 101, is surely one of the world's most famous short pieces, and has been since it was first published. Arrangements of this slight work have been made for every imaginable instrument and ensemble, most of them by the original publisher (N. Simrock) with Dvorak's knowledge; the arrangement made for violin and piano by Fritz Kreisler was so famous in its day that many forgot altogether that the work was originally for piano.\n\nThe Humoresques are among Dvorak's last works for keyboard. Composed in 1894, they are followed only by the Two Pieces, B. 188 (\"Berceuse\" and \"Capriccio\"), written later the same year. As such, they represent the composer's mature synthesis of the character piece genre with his innate, spontaneous sense of melody and the ever-present influence of his native Czech folk music. All eight of the Humoresques are, at times, reminiscent of Johannes Brahms in their combination of relatively conservative musical language, robust textures, and warm tunefulness.\n\nIt took Dvorak a few years to put the pieces of Op. 101 into their finished shapes. He jotted down most of the melodies and themes during his stay in the United States (1892-1895), but he didn't set about fleshing them out until the summer of 1894 (during a brief and welcome return to Bohemia for the summer). At first he thought of calling the set New Scottish Dances (a follow-up to the Scottish Dances, Op. 41, of the late 1870s), since they all follow the basic duple-meter and simple rondo-type plan of an Ecossaise dance. But he decided instead to give them the less specific title, Humoresques.\n\n(AllMusic)\n\nPlease take note that the audio AND the sheet music ARE NOT mine. Change the quality to a minimum of 480p if the video is blurry.\n\nOriginal audio: www.classical-music-online.net\n(Performance by: Radoslav Kvapil)\nOriginal sheet music: imslp.org",

In 1770 he was sent to Milan to study under Giovanni Andrea Fioroni, making his debut as a virtuoso two years later. In 1782 he became a member of the Ducal orchestra in Parma, where his students included Nicolo Paganini. In 1802 he was called to Milan to direct the revival of the La Scala orchestra, and in 1808 he became professor of violin at the Milan Conservatory, retiring in 1833. Rolla was known as an extraordinary teacher on his instrument, writing a number of pedagogical works during his years in Milan that are still considered seminal exercises on the violin and viola even today. As a composer, his career paralleled that of Giovanni Battista Viotti, with similar styles and focus. His music consists of eight ballets, 12 symphonies, 39 concertos (including 15 for viola and 25 for violin), three sextets, three quintets, 19 quartets, 41 trios, 12 sonatas, 283 duets, and other smaller chamber works. His music is known by IB numbers.",

        "description": "Composer: Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky (17 June 1882 -- 6 April 1971)\nClarinet: Michel Arrignon\nEnsemble: Ensemble InterContemporain\nConductor: Pierre Boulez\n\nEbony Concerto for clarinet and jazz band, written in 1945\n\n00:00 - I. Allegro moderato \n03:00 - II. Andante\n05:33 - III. Moderato - Con moto - Moderato\n \nStravinsky wrote his Ebony Concerto for jazz bandleader Woody Herman, who premiered it with his ensemble the Thundering Herd in March 1946. It is modeled on the Baroque concerto grosso and obviously incorporates jazz styles popular during the wartime era. Cast in three very short movements -- the whole work lasting about nine minutes -- it is scored for clarinet and jazz band.\nEbony Concerto opens with a lively Allegro moderato, where the themes are rhythmic and quite jerky in their unpredictability. Everything sounds Stravinskyan, though, the jazz elements fusing naturally with the composer's neo-Classical style. The most lyrical-sounding theme comes on clarinet and trombone, recalling a theme in ragtime from the composer's L'histoire du soldat. A reprise of the main material makes up the second half of the first movement.\nThe middle panel is a bluesy Andante, an almost funereal piece in its lazy, dark mists and lower-range writing for the clarinet. The brief middle section is perky and playful, but the main theme returns in all its delicious gloom to close out the movement. The finale, marked Moderato -- Con moto -- Moderato -- Vivo, begins slowly and darkly then turns lively when a cool, bluesy theme is played by clarinet. The music from the opening returns before the playful Vivo section is presented. The work ends slowly, with the kind of tranquil mood, if not the sound of the first movement's close from the composer's contemporary Symphony in 3 Movements.\n[allmusic.com]\n\nOriginal Audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccwFZ6-COec",
